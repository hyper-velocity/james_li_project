# LibLab Assessment Design Guidelines

- Designs were done using TailwindCSS classes.
- I didn't use external UI library, to show you my custom design skills.
- Everything is mobile responsive and doesn't break on any size of device.
- I used dark design schema and used slate and orange colors mainly.
- Disabled, active designs are styled accordingly and interactively.
- I used comic-style google font called `Press Start 2`
